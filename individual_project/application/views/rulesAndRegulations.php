	<h1>Rules &#38; Regulations</h1>

	<p><i>
		It is the responsibility of every participating angler to know, understand and abide by these tournament rules during this competition. Any participant who deliberately violates these rules will immediately be disqualified. Only registered competitors are eligible for points and any potential qualifying prizes. The safety of all anglers and their teammates is their responsibility, and should be the first consideration in all aspects of this competition. All winners and participating anglers may be asked to take and pass a polygraph test at the tournament committee's discretion. If a participant refuses to submit to a polygraph test for any reason, then any potential winnings will automatically be forfeited. Any intentional cheating, harassing of other anglers or any other conduct determined by the tournament staff to be outside the spirit of good sportsmanship will not be tolerated and is grounds for immediate disqualification and permanent ejection from the tournament.

	<p class="red">EXTREME CAUTION AND CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED AT ALL TIMES!!</p>
	<p>During any activity involved with this sport or related competition, the safety of the angler and all others is of the utmost importance and should take precedence over any attempt to catch, handle or release any wild animal including sharks. Additionally, proper care and handling should also be exercised to avoid any injury to a fish. The Blacktip Challenge, it's officers, committee members, general members, and/or assigns assume no responsibility for risk of injury or death that might occur as a result of attempting to capture, handle or release any wild animal, anywhere, under any circumstances.</p>

	<h2>Official Rules</h2>
	<p><i>
	The following (entire page) are not the complete rules for the Blacktip Challenge and everything written below is subject to change. All content listed in these rules, which is written under a bold heading is categorized according to the clear “common sense” definition of that word and every angler and/or participant/contestant is subject to how these rules are written, and must abide by them. It is the responsibility of every participating angler to know, understand and abide by these tournament rules during this competition. Any participant who deliberately violates these rules will immediately be disqualified. All disqualifications will result in being banned from all future Blacktip Challenge events and the angler(s) will forfeit any prize money and will not have a refund of registration and tournament fees.
	</i></p>
	

	<!--==== Honor System -->
	<p class="hbold">IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING THE HONOR SYSTEM</p>
	<p>All guidelines regarding claims for points or world records submissions are referenced herein. As with other organized sporting events and organizations, the integrity of the Blacktip Challenge relies upon all participant's respect for sportsmanship, honesty and integrity when competing in this tournament or submitting claims. It is the tournament organizer's sincere intent to operate based on a confidence and trust that those virtues, at a minimum, will be held in high regard and exercised at all times by all participants and competitors.</p>
	

	<!--==== Catch & Release -->
	<p class="hbold">Catch &#38; Release Format</p>
	<p>The Blacktip Challenge is a catch and release tournament. Sharks caught in the tournament must be properly documented with tags (supplied), measurements and photographs, then released to qualify for points. No sharks may be used as bait. These requirements are detailed below. If an angler intentionally kills or injuries any shark, he or she will be disqualified from the tournament. This policy does not apply if a shark dies after being released, and it is determined the angler put forth acceptable and well-intentioned efforts to execute a healthy release. If an expired and tournament tagged shark is discovered and reported, the Blacktip Challenge staff will investigate before make its final determination, regarding the circumstances, point eligibility, angler status, etc. The use of gaffs is prohibited and will result in immediate disqualification and a lifetime ban from all future Blacktip Challenge events.</p>
	

	<!--==== Anglers Meeting -->

	<!--==== Tournament Boundaries -->
	<p class="hbold">Tournament Participation &#38; Boundaries</p>
	<p>All fishing must take place on the Atlantic &#40;East&#41; side of Florida, and will be conducted exclusively from the beach. Any fish caught from a pier, dock, bridge, or any other structure will not qualify for points. No fish can be hooked on any structure stated above and then landed on the beach. Every fish must be hooked and landed on the beach. Any angler who submits any shark caught from any structure besides the beach will result in a disqualification from the tournament.</p>
	
	<p>The geographic fishing boundaries of the Blacktip Challenge will stretch north and south from St. Augustine to Key Biscayne. Any participant in the tournament who is caught fishing outside these boundaries will immediately be disqualified. Any angler who submits any fish caught outside these boundaries will not only forfeit that catch, but will be disqualified.</p>

	<p class="image_caption" id="tournament_boundaries">Tournament Boundaries.</p>
	

	<!--==== Angling Rules -->
	<p class="hbold">Angling Rules</p>

	<p>The maximum number of anglers permitted on each team is five (5), the minimum is two (2). All members of a team must fished together. Teams cannot split up to cover "more ground". Anglers are permitted to "solo fish" or enter and participate by themselves without a teammate. Each angler is required to pay their own entry fee regardless of whether or not they are fishing on a team. However, due to the nature of this sport, and in the interests of safety, we encourage competitors not to fish alone in accordance with the tournament rules. Competing anglers may fish with one another. Anglers are not permitted to fish with other anglers not participating in the tournament. This could potentially create controversy. Anglers may receive help from individuals (who are not actively fishing) that are not participating in the tournament. In any case, registered and competing anglers must follow all rules, and are responsible to inform any non-participants assisting them to do so.</p>
	
	<p>Once an angler is hooked up, they must fight the fish without assistance from another individual. Should an angler choose to leader, tail rope, or otherwise land their own fish, they may temporarily hand off their pole. Should the fish take another run, causing the fight to resume, the angler must then retrieve their pole and continue fighting the fish. Anglers may be assisted by others in landing a fish using acceptable means, such as leadering or tail roping. However, the angler must remain on the rod at all times unless using the option(s) previously mentioned. Anglers may also be assisted with tagging, measuring, hook removal (at angler's discretion), photographing, and releasing fish. If an angler is hooked up prior to 'Lines out' and continues to fight the fish after that time, it will still qualify for potential points, if landed and documented.</p>
	
	<p>All participants and anglers fishing in the Blacktip Challenge must abide by Florida State Laws. All anglers fishing in the tournament (both Florida natives and out of state participants) are required to have the proper fishing licenses required by the FWC (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Committee). Failure to have proper licenses will result in immediate disqualification and will be reported to the FWC by the tournament committee. Any angler cited by the FWC or any other law enforcement personnel for breaking any state laws will be immediately disqualified from the tournament. It is the responsibility of every angler to understand and abide by the laws and requirements of the FWC. The Blacktip Challenge will be in contact with state and local authorities throughout the tournament.</p>
	
	<p>If you are not familiar with the Fishing Regulations &#38; Guidelines of the FWC, please visit this link: <a href="http://www.eregulations.com/florida/fishing/saltwater/pageFlip/">Saltwater Fishing Regulations</a></p>
	
	<p>Participating anglers are to be respectful of other beach goers and are to show good sportsmanship to non-participants. Fishing at night and early morning is recommended. All anglers are asked to fish away from publicly posted swimming locations, meaning a lifeguard is being paid and on location. If in any situation a registered angler(s) in the Blacktip Challenge is intentionally fishing at a designated public swimming location, jeopardizing the health other beach goers "non-participants", tournament officials will evaluate the situation and may, depending on their interpretation on the situation, disqualify that individual(s).</p>
	

	<!--==== Junior Anglers -->
	<p class="hbold">Junior Anglers</p>
	<p>Anglers under the age of 18 must have a parent and/or legal guardian's consent to enter the tournament, and their parent and/or legal guardian are required to be present at the anglers meeting. Participants under the age of 18 are permitted to solo fish at the discretion and acceptance of both their parent and/or legal guardian and tournament organizers, and must be accompanied by an adult at all times! A team is permitted to have five anglers under the age of 18 under these conditions: 1) The parent(s) and/or legal guardian(s) of each participant must be present at the anglers meeting, 2) The parent(s) and/or legal guardian(s) of each participant are required to sign a unified document stating that all parties agree to the terms of the waiver of liability to permit their child (children) and/or ward(s) to participate in the event and accept all risks and dangers involved. 3) The participating individuals must fish together in the same location at all times and must be accompanied by an adult, being either a parent and/or legal guardian who signed the unified document stated above in (2), or an individual of which their parent(s) and/or legal guardian(s) consider to be a responsible adult to watch their child (children) and/or ward(s).</p>


	<!--==== Scoring -->
	<p class="hbold">Scoring</p>
	<p>Scoring will be broken up into two groups: blacktips sharks and all other species of sharks (excluding nurse sharks). In order to receive points for blacktip sharks, a girth measurement is required. Blacktip measurements will be evaluated based upon the estimated weight formula (Fork Length x Girth^2 / 800). All other species of sharks will only require and overall and fork length measurements. Overall length will determine the largest shark and the fork length will be the tie-breaker.</p>
	
	
	<!--==== Qualifying Species -->
	<p class="hbold">Qualifying Species</p>
	<p>All species of sharks will qualify for points except nurse sharks. Every qualifying shark must be a minimum of 60 inches (5ft) in overall length in order to qualify for points. Prohibited species such as: lemon sharks, hammerheads, and tiger sharks will qualify for points. These sharks must be quickly released and anglers are asked to follow <a href="http://myfwc.com/media/131566/Catch_Release.pdf">FWC Saltwater Fish Handling Guidelines</a> in this process.</p>
	
	<p>If an angler submits a shark that is under the minimum size of 60 inches, that angler will forfeit both the under-sized shark and the most recent qualifying shark that was submitted. This will be at the discretion of the tournament organizers. If the under-sized shark is the first entry of that angler, the next shark that is submitted by that angler will be disqualified.</p>
	

	<!--==== Chumming -->
	<p class="hbold">Chumming</p>
	<p>The use of chum in this tournament is prohibited. Any angler caught chumming during any period of the tournament will immediately be disqualified.</p>
	

	<!--==== Cooperative Research and Resource Management -->
	<p class="hbold">Cooperative Research &#38; Resource Management</p>
	<p>In an effort to take proactive and opportunistic steps in marine resource management, the Blacktip Challenge and its anglers are also taking part in an important joint-research effort with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Apex Predator Cooperative Shark Tagging Program and the International Land-Based Shark Fishing Association. This makes the angler's role as a competitor also one of an important contributor to the knowledge and understanding of these animals. For this reason, the accurate gathering and documentation of catch, tag and release data by participating anglers on data cards provided by the event staff is of the utmost importance.</p>
	
	<p>Research tags and applicators will be provided and distributed evenly among anglers. Sharks must be accurately documented with all tags supplied, measured, photographed, then released to qualify for points. Documentation procedure instructions and guidelines are listed on the <a href="shark_tagging.html" title="Documentation on how to properly use reserach tags on sharks">shark tagging page</a>. Should an angler deplete their supply of tags, in accordance with these rules, any additional qualifying sharks caught and released will still count for points. However, for additional sharks to qualify, ALL provided tags must first be deployed within tournament rules and guidelines. All additional sharks must still be properly documented with measurements and photos, and within the scope of all other rules and regulations. All unused tags and corresponding data cards must be returned at tournament's end.</p>
	
	<img src="../images/tagcard.jpg" alt="actual example of completed shark tagging data card" width="500" height="334" />
	<p class="image_caption">Actual example of completed and submitted data card.</p>
	
	<p>By tournament's end, each angler will submit their data cards to the event staff, which will then check them for accuracy, prior to submission to the APEX Predator Tagging Program. This organization will then enter all data into an international database, which is used for various research applications to the direct benefit of shark population studies, biological understanding and natural resource management. Prior to and during the tournament start, the event staff, as well as representatives from the ILSFA and other organizations will work to provide helpful information, and to answer questions about data gathering, as well as the safe capture and release of sharks.</p>
	

	<!--==== Catch Documentation -->
	<p class="hbold">Catch Documentation</p>
	<p>Since this is a catch &#38; release tournament, the healthy release of all captured fish is important. Experience and careful planning will aid in reducing stress on the animal, while helping to ensure healthy releases. Anglers are encouraged to land their fish as quickly as possible, and to maintain landed fish in enough water (as little as a few inches) to aid in the support of their body weight during the required documentation procedure that includes the: tagging, measuring and photographing of all fish as quickly and safely as possible, prior to release. Whenever possible, avoid dragging an entire shark's body weight onto dry sand.</p>
	

	<!--==== Research Tagging -->
	<p class="hbold">Research Tagging</p>
	<p>Tagging needles, tags and applicators similar to the one pictured below are included in entry fees, and will be provided to participating anglers by the tournament staff, along with data cards to record measurements and other information. If you have never tagged a shark before, please visit this link: <a href="shark_tagging.html">How to Tag a Shark</a></p>
	

	<!--==== Measurements -->
	<p class="hbold">Measurements</p>
	<p>Measuring tapes are included in entry fees, and will be provided for all participating anglers by the tournament staff, along with data cards to record measurements and other information. All measurements must be made with the tape measure provided by the tournament. Measurements will be tuned by tournament organizers at their discretion based upon the measurement photos submitted. If you have never measured a shark before, please visit this link: <a href="measuring.html">How to Measure a Shark</a></p>
