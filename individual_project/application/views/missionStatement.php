	<p>The Blacktip Challenge is a catch, tag and release shark fishing tournament on Florida&#39;s East Coast. It is an exciting and beneficial combination of competitive sport fishing, adventure, entertainment, scientific research and education. Anglers that participate in the tournament are educated about proper shark tagging techniques and procedures. Our hope is that anglers continue this practice outside of the tournament. The tournament works with NOAA &#40;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#41;, the Apex Predator Program &#40;Cooperative Shark Tagging Program&#41; and the ILSFA &#40;International Land-Based Shark Fishing Association&#41;. Information collected by anglers is sent to NOAA and the Apex Predator Program for further analysis.</p>
